# PrinterProject

In this project we "hit" and parse 2 pages of Cannon ir2520 printer on a local network. From these pages we take useful information about users' printing actions. By adding these info into a database you have a useful overview of the printing trace.
This software can be used in the backend of a web-app that will provide dashboards and CRUD opparations to the printer's supervisor.
